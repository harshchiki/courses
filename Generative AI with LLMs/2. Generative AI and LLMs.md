# 🧠 Lesson Summary: Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)

## 🎯 Lesson Objectives
- Understand what LLMs are and how they work
- Explore generative AI use cases
- Learn basics of prompt engineering
- Understand project lifecycle in generative AI
- Preview how to build and deploy applications using LLMs

---

## 🤖 What is Generative AI?
- Subset of machine learning
- Uses models trained on massive human-generated datasets
- Capable of creating human-like content (text, images, code, etc.)
- Found in tools like chatbots, code assistants, and text-to-image generators

---

## 🧱 What Are Large Language Models (LLMs)?
- Trained on **trillions of words** using large-scale compute resources
- Built as **foundation models** (or base models)
- Have **billions of parameters** (think of them as model memory)
  - More parameters → greater ability to perform complex tasks
- Exhibit **emergent properties** like reasoning and problem-solving
- Can be used as-is or fine-tuned for specific tasks

---

## 🧪 Models & Tools in This Course
- Use of open-source LLM: **Flan-T5**
- Visualized as **purple circles** in diagrams
- Focus is on **natural language generation** (not images/video/audio)

---

## 💡 How LLMs Work
- Interact with models using **natural language prompts**
- The input text is called a **prompt**
- Model processes prompt and predicts a **completion**
  - This generation process is known as **inference**
  - Completion = Prompt + Model-generated text

---

## 📏 Prompt Engineering Concepts
- **Context window**: amount of memory available for a prompt
  - Usually a few thousand words, varies by model
- Example: Asking where *Ganymede* is located
  - Model outputs: "Ganymede is a moon of Jupiter..." — correct and coherent answer

---

## 🚀 Applications & Project Lifecycle
- LLMs used in business, social, and creative tasks
- Course will cover full lifecycle:
  1. Problem scoping
  2. Model selection and adaptation
  3. Prompt engineering
  4. Fine-tuning
  5. Deployment and integration

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaway
- LLMs represent a **new interaction paradigm** in computing
  - Instead of strict code, you give **natural language instructions**
  - Much more intuitive and human-like approach to programming and task execution
